## Description
JATE is an online text editor for coders. It allows one to install the application to their desktop or use it on the web. It saves input from the user each time the page is out of focus so there is no need to worry about losing your text or code. It also functions offline using a service worker. 

The application was deployed with Heroku, uses Express for the backend, and webpack for the frontend.
